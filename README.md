# Description:

Jimmy The Cop is a 2.5D puzzle platforming game developed in Unity by me and 3 co-students. The core gameplay is based on gravity manipulation that helps in solving different types of puzzles. The game features destructible environment, 
dynamic day-night cycle, different types of enemies and puzzle mechanisms, a multi-stage final boss fight, joystick support with force feedback and much more. 

The game was also showcased at the Reboot Develop 2019 conference as a part of the indie booth section.

# How to use:
After starting the build (.exe file) control the character movement with WASD keys, space bar is used for jumping. Mouse is used for aiming the gravity push/pull powers while shift turns on the gravity field power.

The goal of the game is to solve puzzles and beat the boss stage in the second level.
